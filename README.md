# TensorFlow Python Image Recognition

This example shows how you can load a pre-trained TensorFlow network and use it
to recognize objects in images in AWS Single EC2 Instance.

We have an input file (Gracehopper image) in data folder.

And we get result similar to this after we run the model:
```
military uniform 0.834305
mortarboard 0.0218694
academic gown 0.0103581
pickelhaube 0.00800818
bulletproof vest 0.0053509
```
